# Meal Cost Splitter

## Overview

The **Meal Cost Splitter** is a simple web-based application that allows users to input the total amount of money, the remainder, and the number of meals each person has consumed. The application then calculates and displays how much each person needs to contribute based on their meal consumption.

## Features

- **Input Fields**:
  - Total Taka (Total amount of money available).
  - Remainder (Amount to be excluded from the total).
  - Meal count for each person (Alif, Alhaz, Rifat, Aarid, Mostafa).

- **Calculation**: After entering the required information, the application calculates how much each individual needs to contribute based on their share of the total spent money.

- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be responsive and can be accessed across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the basic structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface, including layout, colors, and button effects.
- **JavaScript**: For handling input validation, calculations, and displaying the results.
